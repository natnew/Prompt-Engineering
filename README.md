# Prompt Engineering Tool

## Overview

The **Prompt Engineering Tool** is an interactive Streamlit app designed to help users learn and experiment with different prompt engineering techniques. Users can apply various techniques to prompts and see how different language models, like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, respond. The app provides a hands-on learning experience by allowing users to choose from different models, departments, example prompts, and prompt engineering techniques.

## Features

- **Model Selection**: Choose from different language models such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
- **Department Context**: Select a department (e.g., Marketing, Customer Support, Data Science) to receive relevant example prompts.
- **Interactive Prompt Engineering**: Apply various prompt engineering techniques like Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, and Instruction Tuning.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: See how your prompt transforms and how the model responds in real-time.
