"""models.py - Model Selection and Text Completion Utilities for Streamlit App
This module provides functions to interact with OpenAI's API, allowing users to select models and generate text completions.
It includes functionality to ensure that the generated text ends with a complete sentence and handles rate limits gracefully
by retrying requests. It provides utility functions for:
1. Selecting and managing supported models.
2. Making robust API calls to fetch completions with retries and adaptive prompts.
3. Ensuring natural, complete, and polite text endings in generated outputs.

Functions include:
- `is_complete_sentence(text)`: Checks if the text ends with a complete sentence.
- `ensure_complete_ending(text)`: Ensures the text has a complete ending, appending a polite closing statement if necessary.
- `get_model_response(model, prompt, temperature=None, top_p=None, max_tokens=None)`: Fetches a response from the selected model, ensuring it is complete and handling rate limits.
This module is designed to be used within a Streamlit application, providing a user-friendly interface for

    Generate a complete response from the specified OpenAI model with robust error handling.
    
    This function handles the complete workflow of generating text from OpenAI models,
    including input sanitization, parameter validation, rate limit handling, and
    ensuring complete sentence endings. It supports both standard GPT models and
    specialized models like o1-preview/o1-mini with their specific parameter requirements.
    
    Args:
        model (str): The model identifier from the MODELS dictionary. Must be a valid
                    OpenAI model name (e.g., "gpt-4o", "gpt-3.5-turbo").
        prompt (str): The user's input prompt to send to the model. Will be sanitized
                     to prevent prompt injection attacks.
        temperature (float, optional): Controls randomness in output (0.0-2.0).
                                     Defaults to 0.7 for most models, 1.0 for o1 models.
        top_p (float, optional): Controls nucleus sampling (0.0-1.0).
                                Defaults to 1.0 for all models.
        max_tokens (int, optional): Maximum tokens to generate. Defaults to 500 for
                                   standard models, 10000 for o1 models.
    
    Returns:

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the model is not in the approved MODELS list.
        
    Side Effects:
        - Displays Streamlit error/warning messages for user feedback
