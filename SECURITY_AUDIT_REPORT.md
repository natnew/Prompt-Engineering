# Security Audit Report

**Project:** Prompt Engineering Streamlit Application  
**Audit Date:** February 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Analysis  

## Executive Summary

This security audit reveals several **HIGH** and **MEDIUM** risk vulnerabilities in the Python Streamlit application. The primary concerns include insecure API key handling, dependency vulnerabilities, potential injection attacks, and unsafe file operations. Immediate action is required to secure this application before production deployment.

## üö® Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **API Key Security Issues** - HIGH RISK

**Location:** `src/models.py:7`, `src/machine_learning.py:4`, `src/app.py:87`

**Issue:** Inconsistent and potentially insecure API key handling
- Three different methods for accessing OpenAI API keys
- `machine_learning.py` uses `st.secrets.get()` while `models.py` uses `os.getenv()`
- Potential for API key exposure in logs or error messages

**Code Examples:**
```python
# src/models.py - Line 7
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# src/machine_learning.py - Line 4
openai.api_key = st.secrets.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", None)
```

**Impact:** API key compromise could lead to:
- Unauthorized usage of paid AI services
- Data exfiltration through model interactions
- Service disruption via rate limiting

**Recommendation:**
- Standardize on Streamlit secrets management
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak key information
- Add API key validation and rotation procedures

### 2. **Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities** - HIGH RISK

**Location:** `src/prompt_engineering.py`, `src/app.py:user_prompt`

**Issue:** User-provided prompts are directly concatenated without sanitization
- No input validation on user prompts
- Potential for prompt injection attacks
- User input directly passed to AI models without filtering

**Code Example:**
```python
# src/app.py - User input directly used
user_prompt = st.text_area("See/Type your prompt below:", value=selected_prompt)
formatted_prompt = f"{transformed_prompt}\n\nFormat the output in {output_format} format with a {tone} tone."
```

**Impact:**
- Malicious users could manipulate AI responses
- Potential data extraction from the AI model
- Bypass of intended functionality

**Recommendation:**
- Implement input sanitization and validation
- Add prompt injection detection patterns
- Set character limits and content filtering

### 3. **Dependency Vulnerabilities** - MEDIUM to HIGH RISK

**Location:** `requirements.txt`

**Issues Found:**
- **OpenAI library version 0.27.8** - Outdated version with known security issues
- **Unpinned dependencies** - `pillow`, `numpy`, `anthropic`, etc. without version constraints
- **Missing security updates** for multiple packages

**Current Dependencies:**
```txt
openai==0.27.8           # VULNERABLE - Should be >= 1.0.0
pillow                   # UNPINNED - Security risk
numpy                    # UNPINNED - Security risk
```

**Impact:**
- Known vulnerabilities in outdated packages
- Supply chain attacks through unpinned dependencies
- Compatibility issues and unexpected behavior

**Recommendation:**
- Update OpenAI library to latest stable version (1.x)
- Pin all dependency versions with security considerations
- Implement automated dependency scanning

### 4. **File Handling Security Issues** - MEDIUM RISK

**Location:** `src/utils.py`, `src/app.py` (audio processing)

**Issues:**
- File path construction using `os.path.join()` with user-controlled input
- Temporary file handling in audio processing without proper cleanup
- Potential path traversal vulnerabilities

**Code Example:**
```python
# src/utils.py - Potential path traversal
file_path = os.path.join(script_dir, '..', filename)
```

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized file access
- Directory traversal attacks
- Temporary file exposure

**Recommendation:**
- Validate and sanitize all file paths
- Use secure temporary file handling
- Implement proper access controls

## üîç Additional Security Concerns

### 5. **Information Disclosure** - MEDIUM RISK

**Location:** `src/models.py`, error handling throughout application

**Issues:**
- Verbose error messages that could leak system information
- Stack traces potentially exposed to users
- Model response handling without content filtering

**Recommendation:**
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Log detailed errors server-side only
- Add content filtering for AI responses

### 6. **Authentication & Authorization** - MEDIUM RISK

**Issues:**
- No user authentication mechanism
- No rate limiting on API calls
- No session management

**Recommendation:**
- Implement user authentication if required
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Consider session management for user state

### 7. **Input Validation** - MEDIUM RISK

**Location:** Throughout the application

**Issues:**
- Insufficient validation on user inputs
- No sanitization of special characters
- File upload validation missing for audio files

**Recommendation:**
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Add file type and size validation
- Sanitize all user inputs

## üìã Compliance with Current Security Standards

### Missing Security Headers
- No Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Missing security headers in Streamlit configuration
- No HTTPS enforcement configuration

### OWASP Top 10 Alignment
- **A03:2021 - Injection**: Vulnerable to prompt injection
- **A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration**: Missing security configurations
- **A06:2021 - Vulnerable Components**: Outdated dependencies
- **A09:2021 - Security Logging**: Insufficient security logging
